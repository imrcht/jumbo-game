# Real-Time Quiz Game

A real-time quiz game where two players compete against each other by answering a series of questions. The game is built using **Node.js** for the backend, **MongoDB** for the database, and **WebSockets** for real-time communication. Players are authenticated using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, and the game handles **question delivery, answer validation, scoring, and result calculation in real-time**.

## Features

### User Authentication:

- Register and log in using **JWT** for secure authentication.
- Passwords are securely hashed before storing in the database.

### Game Session Setup:

- Start a new game session and match two players.
- Notify both players when the game starts using **WebSockets**.

### Real-Time Question Delivery:

- Players receive questions one at a time in real-time.
- Questions are fetched from a pre-stored set in the database.

### Answer Submission and Scoring:

- Players submit their answers via **WebSocket**.
- Answers are validated, and scores are updated in real-time.

### Result Calculation:

- After both players answer all questions, the final scores are calculated.
- The winner is determined, and results are sent to both players.

### Database Storage:

- Game session results are stored in **MongoDB** for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Minimalistic frontend for demonstration)
